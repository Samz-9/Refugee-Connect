# 🌍 Climate Refugee Connect

**Climate Refugee Connect** is a humanitarian-focused web platform built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to support people displaced by climate change. Our mission is to help affected individuals and families find **safety**, **opportunity**, and **hope** in welcoming communities around the world.

## ✨ About the Project

Millions are being displaced due to the impacts of climate change — rising sea levels, droughts, floods, and more. **Climate Refugee Connect** provides a compassionate and tech-powered way to match individuals in need with communities and organizations ready to help.

We use a smart system that considers a refugee’s:

- 🌐 **Language**
- 💼 **Skills**
- 📍 **Location safety**
  
And we recommend safe places, NGOs, and job opportunities suited to their background.
